# Peritum
Imagine a place where people come together to collect knowledge. To share it. To help, collab and find solutions to the trickiest problems. __Solutions for everyone. Everywhere.__

## Open source
To make Peritum open to everyone, the website is completely open source and everybody can read the source code, suggest improvements or find security issues.

## The name
"Peritum" comes from the latin word "Expert", because everyone is an Expert at something, and collecting thousands of Experts creates one __giant expert__.
