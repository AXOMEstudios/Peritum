# Peritum
Peritum is a place where everyone shares knowledge, stories and ideas. Peritum should be the place where you can find what you searched - with enough effort, it can even **be** this place.

## The idea
Everyone is a genius at something, anything is your passion, right? When we collect hundreds, or even better: thousands of people just like **you**, we can create the platform Peritum should be.

But… why exactly should you sit down and write an article about whatever you‘re interested in, without getting paid?!
There are a bunch of reasons. First of all: it‘s fun. It‘s really fun, because Peritum is the perfect mix of lexicon and social media: likes, comments, stars (like retweets) and profiles with biographies and pictures… you get a feeling of funny social media activities! Second reason: your article is **very probably** getting read. The Peritum article is really fair; it recommends articles on the start page based on their publishing date; so every new article, **including yours** is probably getting read, liked, starred or even commented.
You see, it‘s really fun and interesting to use Peritum!

## Roadmap
We‘re not at the end of out journey yet! We still want to…
- get to production state
- maybe add a following system
- improve the recommendation algorithm
- add an extra domain
- etc.

#### We‘re interested in what you will create on Peritum! Stay tuned for further updates!

## Open source
To make Peritum open to everyone, the website is completely open source and everybody can read the source code, suggest improvements or find security issues.

## The name
"Peritum" comes from the latin word "Expert", because everyone is an Expert at something, and collecting thousands of Experts creates one __giant expert__.
